abstract: Software developers are key players in the security ecosystem as they produce
  code that runs on millions of devices. Yet we continue to see insecure code being
  developed and deployed on a regular basis despite the existence of support infrastructures,
  tools, and research into common errors. This work provides a systematised overview
  of the relatively new field of Developer-Centred Security which aims to understand
  the context in which developers produce security-relevant code as well as provide
  tools and processes that that better support both developers and secure code production.
  We report here on a systematic literature review of 49 publications on security
  studies with software developer participants. We provide an overview of both the
  types of methodologies currently being used as well as the current research in the
  area. Finally, we also provide recommendations for future work in Developer-Centred
  Security.
