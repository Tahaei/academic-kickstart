abstract: "Mobile advertising networks present personalised advertisements to developers as a way to increase revenue, these typesof ads use data about users to select potentially more relevantcontent, but the choice framing also impacts developers’ deci-sions which in turn impacts their users’ privacy. Currently, adnetworks provide choices in developer-facing dashboards thatcontrol the types of information collected by the ad networkas well as how users will be asked for consent. Framing andnudging have been shown to impact users’ choices about privacy, we anticipate that they have a similar impact on choicesmade by developers. We conducted a survey-based onlineexperiment with 400 participants with experience in mobileapp development. Across six conditions, we varied the choiceframing of options around ad personalisation. Participants inthe condition where privacy consequences of ads personali-sation are highlighted in the options are significantly (11.06 times) more likely to choose non-personalised ads comparedto participants in the Control condition with no informationabout privacy. Participants’ choices of an ad type are driven byimpact on revenue, user privacy, and relevance to users. Ourfindings suggest that developers are impacted by interfacesand need transparent options."
