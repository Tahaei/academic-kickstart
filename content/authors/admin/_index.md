I advocate for including the human factor in the design process of privacy and security technologies. My current research looks at privacy and security technologies and interfaces directed at software developers. I apply qualitative and quantitative methods for evaluating, designing, and building such technologies and interfaces that can assist software developers in building private and secure systems.
